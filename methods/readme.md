Performance Metrics for Model
  Mean Absolute Error (MAE): measures average absolute error between the predicted and the acutal values; helpful to understand prediciton accuracy
  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Penalizes larger errors more than MAE, useful to detect outliers
    May not use due to its complexity to interpret
  Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (MSLE): Good for handling skewed data, especially if he blood results of exponential variations


Metrics for Lifestyle Recommendations
  Mean Absolute Error (MAE) : measures overall prediciton accuracy of blood marker values
  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Highlights large deviations in predictions; this is useful for identifying extreme deficiencies like anemia
    may not use due to its complexity to interpret
  R^2 score: Evaluates how well the model explains the variation in blood results
  F-1 score: Important for classifying whether the user is deficient, borderline, or sufficient in some nutrient
  Feaure importance scores: helps to determine which blood markers contribute the most to lifestyle change recommendations

Metrics Specfic to supplement suggestion
  Dosages for supplementaion
  Pre and post blood levels : measure the changes in markers after following supplement recommendation to gage if effective 
  Effectiveness of supplementation: percetange of users who wo improvements after the apprpriate time 

Clinical and health based metric
  Deficiency detection sensitivity: measures how well the model identifies true nutrient difincies like vitmain D, iron, B12. 
    We can check this through the actual report and deficiency reported by the healthcare provider???
  Specificty: Ensures that we dont over prescribe when not necessary

User Friendly
  Feedback score: the user can rate whether the suggestions have been helpful to them
  Dropout rate: Track users who stop following the supplemnt plans and why
  Health Improvement score: measures self-reported imporvements in areas such as sleep and overall well being.
