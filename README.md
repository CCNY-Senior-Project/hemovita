## Team Name
**Theranos**

## Team Members and Roles
- **Selma Doganata** - Project Manager / Developer
- **Jubyaid Uddin** - Machine Learning Engineer
- **Rahat Rahman** - Researcher / Data Analyst

## Project Overview
**HemaVita AI** is an **AI-powered blood screening system** designed to detect **nutrient deficiencies** and recommend **personalized supplement plans**. Using **machine learning**, the system analyzes blood test results, identifies key deficiencies, and suggests **supporting vitamins and minerals** to enhance absorption and effectiveness.

### Features:
- **Automated Bloodwork Analysis:** Identifies deficiencies in essential nutrients.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests supplements and dietary adjustments.
- **Absorption Optimization:** Recommends co-factors that improve nutrient uptake.
- **Scalability & Adaptability:** Designed for integration with various medical datasets.
