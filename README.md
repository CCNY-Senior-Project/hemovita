## 🛠️ How HemoVita Stands Out  
| **Feature** | **HemoVita** | **Existing Blood Screening Systems** |
|------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| **Nutrient-Specific Analysis** | ✔ Focuses on **micronutrient deficiencies** | ❌ Primarily detects **diseases** |
| **AI-Driven Recommendations** | ✔ Suggests **supplements and diet adjustments** | ❌ Limited to general **blood test interpretations** |
| **Data Integration** | ✔ Can be integrated with **various medical datasets** | ❌ Often reliant on **fixed datasets** |
