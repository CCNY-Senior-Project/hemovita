## 📌 Problem Definition & Scope  

### **🚨 Problem Statement**  
Nutritional deficiencies affect billions, leading to conditions like anemia and osteoporosis. Current blood screening focuses on **disease detection**, while supplement recommendations remain **generic and ineffective** due to **individual absorption differences**.  

### **🎯 Target Application & Significance**  
HemoVita bridges this gap by using **AI to detect deficiencies and provide personalized nutrition insights**, enhancing **diagnostic precision** and **nutrient absorption** while enabling scalability in healthcare.  

HemoVita aims to fill this gap by developing an **AI-driven blood screening system** that not only **identifies micronutrient deficiencies** but also **provides personalized supplement recommendations**. This approach enhances **diagnostic precision**, and improves **nutrient absorption**.

### **📌 Scope & Assumptions**  
- **Scope:**  
  - AI-based **blood test analysis** for **micronutrient deficiencies**  
  - **Personalized supplement & diet recommendations**  
  - Designed for **individuals, healthcare providers, and researchers**  

- **Assumptions & Limitations:**  
  - **High-quality blood test data** availability is essential  
  - **Does not replace medical professionals** but aids decision-making  
  - **User compliance** impacts effectiveness
