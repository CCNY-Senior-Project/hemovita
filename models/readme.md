# Model Architectures for HemoVita AI
## Overview
The Model Architectures subtask focuses on evaluating AI models that analyze bloodwork data to detect nutrient deficiencies and recommend personalized supplement plans. 
The choice of model architectures plays a crucial role in:
- Extracting meaningful insights from bloodwork data
- Improving accuracy in detecting deficiencies
- Providing explainable AI recommendations for supplementation

## Existing Technologies and Methodologies

Several existing machine learning and deep learning architectures are relevant to this problem. Below are three commonly used approaches in similar applications:

### 1. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)

- **Technology:** Fully connected deep learning models trained on structured blood test datasets.

- **Strengths:**
  - Highly scalable and can process large datasets efficiently.
  - Effective for handling complex relationships between biomarkers.

- **Weaknesses:**
  - Requires large amounts of labeled data.
  - Can be difficult to interpret without additional explainability techniques.

- **Applicability:**
  - Suitable for HemoVita AI when trained with sufficient clinical data to detect nutrient deficiencies.

### 2. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)

- **Technology:** Ensemble learning methods for structured health data analysis.

- **Strengths:**
  - Works well with smaller datasets compared to deep learning.
  - Provides feature importance scores, improving interpretability.
  - Efficient for tabular datasets like bloodwork.

- **Weaknesses:**
  - May not capture complex, nonlinear interactions as effectively as deep learning.

- **Applicability:**
  - Useful as a baseline model for detecting patterns in blood test data before implementing deep learning solutions.
