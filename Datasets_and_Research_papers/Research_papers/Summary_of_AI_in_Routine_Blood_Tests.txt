Problem Statement:
This paper explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in routine blood tests for 
diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring. Traditional clinical decision support systems rely on 
predefined biomarkers, potentially missing hidden patterns in blood test data. AI has the potential to 
extract subtle correlations that could improve diagnostic accuracy and enable early detection of 
various conditions, including anemia, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and COVID-19. However, challenges 
remain in validating AI models, ensuring clinical interpretability, and overcoming regulatory barriers.

Dataset Used:
The study reviews 54 research papers applying machine learning to routine blood tests, categorized 
according to the ICD-10 classification. The datasets in these studies include a variety of hematology 
and biochemistry parameters, such as hemoglobin, white blood cells, glucose, cholesterol levels, and 
liver function markers. These datasets come from hospitals, clinical trials, and public health records.

Methodologies Used:
The paper examines different machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques used to analyze 
routine blood test data for disease detection and prediction, including:

      - Supervised Learning Models: Used for disease classification and prediction 
        (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks).

      - Unsupervised Learning & Clustering: Applied for pattern recognition and anomaly detection in 
        blood test data.

      - Deep Learning (DL): Used for complex feature extraction, especially in identifying unknown 
        relationships between blood markers and diseases.

      - Federated Learning (FL): A method allowing AI models to be trained across multiple hospitals 
        without sharing sensitive patient data, improving privacy and generalizability.

Findings:
- AI-Enhanced Diagnostics: Machine learning models significantly improve disease detection accuracy 
  compared to traditional methods.
- Expanded Biomarker Utility: AI identifies previously overlooked blood markers that correlate with 
  chronic diseases, mental health conditions, and infectious diseases.
- Personalized Risk Assessment: AI can assess individual disease risks based on blood test variations, 
  enabling early intervention and prevention.
- Regulatory & Validation Challenges: Despite AI’s potential, models need extensive external validation 
  before clinical deployment to ensure bias-free, reliable predictions.

Relevance to Project:
This research is highly relevant to HemoVita AI, as it highlights how AI can be leveraged to analyze 
routine bloodwork and uncover hidden nutrient deficiencies. The study reinforces the need for:
✔ Data-driven AI models to improve diagnostic accuracy.
✔ Integration with medical datasets for enhanced scalability.
✔ Personalized recommendations for preventive healthcare.
