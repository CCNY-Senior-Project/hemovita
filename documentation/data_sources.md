### **1. Blood-Analysis Github**  
- **Features:** Implements AI-driven analysis of blood test results to detect potential health conditions.  
- **Usability:** Utilizes deep learning models trained on clinical datasets to provide diagnostic insights.  
- **Strength:** Provides robust detection of abnormalities but does not offer personalized nutrient recommendations.  

### **2. Hemo-Detect Github**  
- **Features:** AI-powered tool designed to identify blood disorders, including anemia and clotting disorders.  
- **Usability:** Leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other machine learning techniques to analyze hematological data.  
- **Strength:** Offers high accuracy in detection but lacks a comprehensive approach to dietary or nutritional guidance.  

### **3. Survival Analysis of Heart Failure Patients: A Case Study**  
- **Features:** Examines survival rates of heart failure patients using statistical and machine learning models.  
- **Usability:** Applies Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression to assess patient outcomes based on clinical variables.  
- **Strength:** Provides insights into risk factors affecting survival but does not focus on blood-related nutritional deficiencies.  

### **4. Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Information System - WHO**  
- **Features:** A global database that compiles information on micronutrient deficiencies, including iron, vitamin A, and iodine.  
- **Usability:** Provides country-level data and trends on vitamin and mineral intake, deficiencies, and health impacts.  
- **Strength:** Offers a comprehensive dataset but does not include AI-driven predictive analysis.  

### **5. NCHS Data Query System - CDC**  
- **Features:** A publicly accessible database that provides statistics on health conditions, including anemia and other blood-related issues.  
- **Usability:** Allows users to query large-scale national health datasets for trends in blood disorders, nutrition, and disease prevalence.  
- **Strength:** Delivers authoritative health data but lacks AI-powered diagnostic tools or real-time prediction capabilities.
